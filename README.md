## Aims
To investigate the Man in Middle attack in the context of Bluetooth-enabled medical or fitness IoT devices
Background: Bluetooth technology especially Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) takes over the market of medical and fitness IoT devices. This is as a result offering affordable and convenient communication medium for those particular devices. However, since there are different versions of Bluetooth and each version is dependant upon the integrated hardware, this instigates many security concerns such as Man in Middle attack. It is important to test all Bluetooth version available on medical and fitness devices to check if they are prone to this type of the attack.
